                You should have good understanding of whats written in flowchart in order to convert to the pseudocode that everyone will understand as they understand flowchart or algorithm.

                Flowcharts are the graphical representation of how the code works or how the program flows. Flowcharts are written from the top of the page to bottom with the program flow. Each command is placed in a box of the appropriate shape and arrows are used to show or direct the flow of the program.

            <p>WHEREAS, Pseudocode is a method of describing the algorithms using mixed programming and natural language . Pseudocode is written as a preparation to write code before actually writing code. There are no hard hand rules for writing pseudocode although pseudocodes are frequently written and used.</p>
