                As we know, loop is that condition in which a statement or a section of code is repeated number of times until the particular condition or number of conditions met.

Or, simply, while loop executes a set of statements as long as the condition is true.

While loop repeats a specific block of code number of times until the particular condition is met.

    while (i < 6) 
         OUTPUT i
         increase i by 1
    end while
end while_loop 
OUTPUT
